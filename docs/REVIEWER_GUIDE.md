# Reviewer Guide — Open Journal System

## Overview

As a **Reviewer**, you receive **review assignments** from editors. You read the submission and submit a **review** with a recommendation and comments.

## Logging in

Log in with the account that has the **Reviewer** role. If you don’t have an account, an administrator must create one and assign you the Reviewer role.

## Dashboard

The **Reviewer Dashboard** shows:

- **Pending reviews** — assignments not yet completed
- **Completed reviews** — assignments you have already submitted

A table lists your assignments with submission title, author, and status (**assigned** or **completed**).

## Submitting a review

1. From the dashboard or **My Reviews**, find an assignment with status **assigned** and click **Submit Review**.
2. You will see the submission title and author. Fill in:
   - **Recommendation** (required): Accept, Minor Revisions, Major Revisions, or Reject
   - **Comments for Author** — feedback that can be shared with the author
   - **Comments for Editor** — confidential notes for the editor only
   - **Rating** (optional) — e.g. 1–5
3. Click **Submit Review**.

After submission, the assignment is marked **completed** and cannot be edited.

## What editors see

Editors see your recommendation and both comment fields. They use this, along with other reviews, to decide: **Accept**, **Reject**, or **Revisions Requested**.

## Tips

- Be constructive in comments for the author.
- Use “Comments for Editor” for confidential or sensitive remarks.
- Submit before the due date if one is set.
