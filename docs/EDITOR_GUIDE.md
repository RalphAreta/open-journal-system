# Editor Guide — Open Journal System

## Overview

As an **Editor**, you manage the submission queue: assign **reviewers**, view **reviews**, and make **editorial decisions** (Accept, Reject, Revisions Requested).

## Logging in

Log in with an account that has the **Editor** role. Admins can assign this role in the Admin panel.

## Dashboard

The **Editor Dashboard** shows:

- **Total submissions**
- **New (Submitted)** — not yet under review
- **Under review** — at least one reviewer assigned
- **Decisions pending** — under review or revisions requested, awaiting your decision

A table lists recent submissions with title, author, status, and a **Manage** link.

## Managing submissions

1. Go to **Submissions** (or use the dashboard table) and click **Manage** on a submission.
2. You’ll see:
   - Author, status, abstract
   - All **reviews** (reviewer name, recommendation, comments for editor, and comments for author)

## Assigning reviewers

1. On the submission’s **Manage** page, in the **Assign Reviewer** section:
   - Choose a **Reviewer** (users with the Reviewer role).
   - Optionally set a **Due date**.
2. Click **Assign**.

The submission status becomes **Under review**. You can assign more than one reviewer per submission.

## Making a decision

1. On the same **Manage** page, use the **Editor Decision** section.
2. Choose:
   - **Accept** — accept for publication
   - **Reject** — decline
   - **Revisions Requested** — request changes from the author
3. Optionally add **Notes** (e.g. to the author or for internal use).
4. Click **Record Decision**.

The submission status is updated and the author can see the outcome (and editor notes) on their submission view.

## Workflow summary

1. Author submits → status **Submitted**
2. Editor assigns reviewer(s) → status **Under review**
3. Reviewers submit reviews → assignments **completed**
4. Editor makes decision → **Accepted** / **Rejected** / **Revisions requested**
5. If revisions requested, author may edit and resubmit; you can assign reviewers again or make a new decision.

## Tips

- Assign at least one reviewer before making a decision.
- Use editor notes to explain decisions or request specific revisions.
