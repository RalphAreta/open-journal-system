# Author Guide — Open Journal System

## Overview

As an **Author**, you can submit articles to the journal and track their status through the review process.

## Logging in

- Use the **Login** link on the home page. New users can **Register**; by default you receive the **Author** role.

## Dashboard

After login you are taken to the **Author Dashboard**, which shows:

- **Total submissions** — number of articles you have submitted
- **Submitted** — waiting in the queue
- **Under review** — with reviewers
- **Accepted** — accepted for publication
- **Rejected** — not accepted

A table lists your submissions with title, status, and submission date.

## Submitting an article

1. From the dashboard or **My Submissions**, click **New Submission**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Abstract** (required)
   - **Keywords** (optional, comma-separated)
   - **Article file** (required): PDF, DOC, or DOCX (max 10 MB)
3. Click **Submit**.

The submission appears in your list with status **Submitted**.

## Editing a submission

You can edit a submission only while its status is **Submitted** or **Revisions Requested**. Once it is **Under review** or a decision has been made, editing is locked.

1. Open **My Submissions** and click **View** on the submission.
2. If **Edit** is available, click it and update the form and/or replace the file.
3. Click **Update**.

## Viewing feedback

- On the submission **View** page you can see:
  - **Editor notes** (if any)
  - **Reviews** — including comments for the author and the reviewer’s recommendation (e.g. Accept, Minor/Major Revisions, Reject)

## Statuses

- **Submitted** — received, not yet sent to reviewers
- **Under review** — with one or more reviewers
- **Revisions requested** — editor asked for revisions; you may edit and resubmit if the system allows
- **Accepted** — accepted for publication
- **Rejected** — not accepted

## Tips

- Keep a copy of your manuscript and abstract before submitting.
- Use a clear, descriptive title and a concise abstract.
- If revisions are requested, address each comment in the revised version.
